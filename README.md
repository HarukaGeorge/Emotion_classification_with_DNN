# Emotion Classification With DNN

## Introduction 

The goal of our project is to develop a deep neural network model for emotion classification, specifically targeting six emotions: happy, sadness, anger, 
love, fear, and surprise. Our aim is to build an accurate and robust model that can accurately classify emotions based on input text data. The model will 
be trained on a large dataset of labeled examples to learn the patterns and features associated with each emotion. The ultimate objective is to create a 
powerful tool that can automatically detect and classify emotions. By achieving this goal, we aim to contribute to the field of emotion recognition. 

## Dataset
The 6 different emotions included are: 
- happy
- sadness
- anger
- love
- fear
- surprise

## Procedure to Use code 

- DNN_Basic.ipynb file has simple model without using SMOTE 
- DNN_with_SMOTE.ipynb file has model run after using SMOTE method
